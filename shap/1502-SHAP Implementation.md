# Diving into Implementation

**Census Income Dataset**

Also known as "Adult" dataset.

It contains weighted census data extracted from the 1994 and 1995 Current Population Surveys conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau.

**OBJECTIVE:** Predict whether income exceeds $50K/yr based on census data.

This is a binary classification problem.

Let's implement SHAP and see how we can derive some interesting inferences through beautiful visualizations.

**PS. Some visualizations are omitted on web so it's better to open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.**
