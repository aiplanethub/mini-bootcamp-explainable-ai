# Hands-On Exercise

Your final score in this bootcamp will be a combination of three components: 10 marks for the quiz, 70 marks from the peer review of your project submission, and 20 marks for reviewing three notebooks from your peers.

The questions/tasks for the project will be uploaded as an AI Challenge on the DPhi website itself. You can find a list of active AI Challenges here: https://dphi.tech/challenges/#active.

Don't worry if you don't see a Challenge for this bootcamp in the first few days - we will release them soon. In the meantime, make sure you go through all the material of the Bootcamp and attempt the quiz. 

Form for submitting your peer review: TBA

Note: Only those who submit their own project will be considered for reviewing others' work.
